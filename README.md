# goodnight_bot
discord goodnight bot to reply to goodnight messages in #general


# main.py

contains python script for the bot. the main functionality is listening for "goodnight" or "gn" messages, liking them, and responding with "Goodnight :)"

this needs to be run in the background somewhere in order for the bot to work.
